# Project Catwalk

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo, then open two terminal tabs and navigate to the root directory.

2. In one of the two separate terminal tabs, run the following script:

```
npm start

```

3. In the second terminal tab run:

```
npm run react:dev
```

4. Open localhost:3000 in the browser and you should see **Hello World!** if React is running correctly.
